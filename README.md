# macos-dotfiles

## Installation

On a fresh macOS installation, you can use the bootstrap script to set everything up.
This will install the package manager Homebrew and setup chezmoi.

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saschahemleb/macos-dotfiles/HEAD/bootstrap.sh)"
```

If you already have Homebrew installed, you can instead install and init chezmoi manually:

```shell
brew install chezmoi
chezmoi init https://github.com/saschahemleb/macos-dotfiles.git
```
